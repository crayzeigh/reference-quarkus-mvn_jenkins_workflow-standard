# reference-quarkus-mvn (Jenkins) (Workflow: Standard)
A reference application that is built and unit tested with Maven
that can be run through the [Ploigos](https://github.com/ploigos) Workflow using
[Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/) for the workflow runner service.

## Source
This is a clone of this [reference app](http://gitea.tssc.rht-set.com/akrohg/reference-quarkus-mvn_jenkins_workflow-standard.git), which is a copy/paste/fork of [rest-json-quickstart](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-quickstarts/tree/master/rest-json-quickstart).  This repo is only to test this reference app by executing a Ploigos Workflow from a GitHub Action.
